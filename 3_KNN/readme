K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.

KNN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.

KNN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using KNN algorithm.

KNN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
