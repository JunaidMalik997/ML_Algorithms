Decision Trees:

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. A decision tree is simply a series of sequential decisions made to reach a specific result.

Random Forests:

Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions. As the name suggests, it is a “forest” of trees!
